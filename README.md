# Liteception
A port of the [Factorissimo2 Inception](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2-Playthrough) to Factorio 2.0.

Start inside a [Factorissimo3](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorissimo-2-notnotmelon?from=search) factory, from which you cannot leave.

## Development
Contributions are welcome!

The various instances of `-- TODO:` throughout the code should be the best place for additional work.

### Space age?
Space age offers several implementation options I haven't made up my mind about yet.
The mod currently gives you all the resources at the start, with no care for their
place in progression. This keeps the mod responsive to resources added by other mods,
but can be somewhat overwhelming with the sheer amount of resources available.

- What should the goal of a space age playthrough be?
- How should asteroids be included?
- How should eggs be handled?
