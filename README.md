# Liteception
A port of [Factorissimo2 Inception](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2-Playthrough) for Factorio 2.0.

Start inside a [Factorissimo3](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorissimo-2-notnotmelon?from=search) factory, from which you cannot leave.

To start a playthrough, please select the Liteception map generation preset.

If you're not getting fluids through the pipes, remember to flip the Factorissimo input! This will be fixed as soon as I figure out how.

## Mod settings
- Starting Factory type
    - If the Factory 3 is too big for you, consider trying the quarter as big Factory 1.
- Starting Factory research
    - Makes you research Factorissimo factory buildings as you usually would have to.

## Development
Contributions are welcome!

The various instances of `-- TODO:` throughout the code should be the best place for additional work. This is my first Factorio modding project, so expect trivial mistakes.
