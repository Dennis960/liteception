# Liteception
A port of [Factorissimo2 Inception](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2-Playthrough) for Factorio 2.0.

Start inside a [Factorissimo3](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorissimo-2-notnotmelon?from=search) factory, from which you cannot leave.

To start a playthrough, please select the Liteception map generation preset.

If you're not getting fluids through the pipes, remember to flip the Factorissimo input! This will be fixed as soon as I figure out how.

## Mod settings
- Starting Factory type
    - If the Factory 3 is too big for you, consider trying the quarter as big Factory 1.
- Starting Factory research
    - Makes you research Factorissimo factory buildings as you usually would have to.

## Development
Contributions are welcome!

The various instances of `-- TODO:` throughout the code should be the best place for additional work. This is my first Factorio modding project, so expect trivial mistakes.

### Space age?
Space age offers several implementation options I haven't made up my mind about yet.
The mod currently gives you all the resources at the start, with no care for their
place in progression. This keeps the mod responsive to resources added by other mods,
but can be somewhat overwhelming with the sheer amount of resources available.

- What should the goal of a space age playthrough be?
- How should asteroids be included?
- How should eggs be handled?
